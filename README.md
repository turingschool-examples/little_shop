# Little Shop
BE Mod 2 Week 2/3 Pair Project

## Background and Description

"Little Shop" is a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can place items into a shopping cart and 'check out' to create Orders in the database.

Students will be put into pairs to complete the project.

## Learning Goals

### Rails
* Describe use cases for a model that inherits from ApplicationRecord vs. a PORO
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
* Make use of flash messages
* Use Inheritance from ApplicationController or a student created controller to store methods that will be used in multiple controllers
* Use POROs to logically organize code for objects not stored in the database

### ActiveRecord
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to:
* create queries that calculate, select, filter, and order data from a single table

### Databases
* Describe Database Relationships, including the following terms:
* Many to Many
* Join Table

### Testing and Debugging
* Write feature tests utilizing
* Sad Path Testing
* Write model tests with RSpec including validations, and class and instance methods

### Web Applications
* Explain how Cookies/Sessions are used to create and maintain application state
* Describe and implement ReSTful routing
* Identify use cases for, and implement non-ReSTful routes
* Identify the different components of URLs(protocol, domain, path, query params)
## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.1.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool
- must include a README to describe their project

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project, please get permission from your instructors first

## Rubric

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** | **Styling, UI/UX** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class to effectively organize code using POROs and adhere to MVC | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class. Even `.each` calls will not cause additional database lookups. | Very clear Test Driven Development. Test files are extremely well organized and nested. Students utilize `before :each` blocks. 100% coverage for features and models | Extremely well styled and purposeful layout. Excellent color scheme and font usage. All other rubric categories score 3 or 4. |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement sad path and edge case functionality. | Students use the principles of MVC and POROs vs. Models to effectively organize code. Students can defend any of their design decisions. | ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data using no Ruby to process data. | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. | Purposeful styling pattern and layout using `application.html.erb`. Links or buttons to reach all areas of the site. |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students complete all but 1 - 3 User Stories | Students utilize MVC and POROs to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. | Styling is poor or incomplete. Incomplete navigation for some routes, i.e. users must manually type URLs. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 4 or more User Stories | Students do not effectively organize code using MVC and/or POROs | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. | No styling or no buttons or links to navigate the site. |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including all sad paths and edge cases, and some extension work completed | Students implement strategies not discussed in class to effectively organize code and adhere to MVC. | Highly effective and efficient use of ActiveRecord beyond what we've taught in class.

No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement sad path and edge case functionality. | Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code. Students can defend any of their design decisions. Students limit access to authorized users. | ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data using no Ruby to process data. | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. | Purposeful styling pattern and layout using `application.html.erb`. Links or buttons to reach all areas of the site. |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students complete all but 1 - 3 User Stories | Students utilize MVC to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. Or some functionality is not limited to the appropriately authorized users. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. | Styling is poor or incomplete. Incomplete navigation for some routes, i.e. users must manually type URLs. |
